Skoice allows players on a Minecraft server to communicate with each other by voice depending on their in-game location. In other words, they are only able to talk to nearby players.

The defining feature of our plugin is that it works with Discord. Therefore, users will not have to download any additional software in order to use the proximity voice chat.

Skoice is currently available in three languages: English, French and German.
